Requirements
You'll need to install the following libraries if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests pdfplumber
This code assumes the PDF has a consistent structure where each ballot box and associated data follows the format specified. If the structure differs, the regular expressions might need to be adjusted.

To extract and aggregate the ballot box-level local election data from the PDF file at the given URL, weâ€™ll need to use a few Python libraries:

Requests to download the file.
PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text from the PDF.
re (regular expressions) to parse and clean the extracted data.
json to save the data to a JSON file.

Explanation
Download the PDF: This section uses requests to download the PDF file and save it locally.
Extract Text: We use pdfplumber to extract the text from each page in the PDF.
Parse Ballot Data: The parse_ballot_data function identifies each ballot box and associated data using regular expressions. It then captures each candidate's name and vote count.
Save as JSON: The extracted data is saved into a JSON file for easy access and further analysis.

To make the application code executable, on UNIX/LINUX (including MacOS) systems software platforms from CLI, <enter> $ chmod u+x scottishLE_example.py
